# ArgoBot-Drive-Training
New developer LabVIEW training using the [ArgoBot platform](http://playingwithfusion.com/productview.php?pdid=65&catid=1009).  This training explores various methods of controlling a robot drive train.

## Prerequisites
+ [LabVIEW](https://www.labviewmakerhub.com/doku.php?id=libraries:labview:start) - Any recent version should work, but the examples are validated using LabVIEW 2016 as distributed by FIRST for the 2017 season
+ [LINX](http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/212478) - LINX provides the interfaces to control the ArgoBot hardware with LabVIEW

## Tutorials
See the [tutorials](https://frc1756-argos.github.io/ArgoBot-Drive-Training/) for exercises using this repository.
